## 🚀 How It Works

1. The simulation creates 8 cars with 3 passengers each
2. Cars move along predefined routes between Madiwala and Attibele
3. Random pickup requests can be added during the simulation
4. The ML model assigns requests to the nearest available car going in the correct direction
5. Passengers are picked up and dropped off at their specified locations

## 🎯 AI/ML Component

The project uses scikit-learn's Nearest Neighbors algorithm to assign pickup requests to the most suitable car based on:
- Current location
- Direction of travel
- Available space

## 🗺️ Routes

The simulation includes the following locations along the route:
- Madiwala
- Bommanahalli
- Singasandra
- Electronic City
- Huskur Gate
- Chandapura
- Heelalige
- Attibele
