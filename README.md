🔥 Features

- **Carpool Matching Algorithm**: An intelligent matching algorithm that connects users based on their travel routes and preferences, optimizing carpooling efficiency.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Powerful ML models that enhance carpool prediction accuracy, ensuring that the most optimal routes and ride-sharing opportunities are provided.
- **Web Interface**: A responsive and user-friendly interface built with *Flask* for Python and *Node.js* for the backend.
- **Simulation Environment**: Test out different carpooling scenarios with the simulation scripts to optimize and assess the performance of carpooling solutions in various conditions.
